## Overview
A Python-based **Turtle Crossing game** built as a capstone project. The player controls a turtle that must cross a busy road while avoiding cars. Demonstrates **OOP**, **event-driven programming**, and basic game mechanics using Python's **Turtle module**.

## Features
- Move the turtle **up** using the **Up Arrow key**
- Randomly generated cars with **increasing speed**
- Level tracking with a **scoreboard**
- Collision detection (game over on crash)
- Level progression upon successful crossing

## Installation
Open terminal (Linux/Mac) or PowerShell/Command Prompt (Windows) and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamidreza1324/Turtle-Crossing-Capstone.git
cd Turtle-Crossing-Capstone

# Linux/Mac:
python3 main.py

# Windows:
python main.py 
```

## Skills & Concepts
